# winacious-skin

Winacious is my version of the default skin for Audacious.

The original (default) skin looks like this:

But that was too dry, meagre and lifeless for me, so I took the time and changed it into what you see below:

Audacious has two sets of skins - "Classic Winamp-like" and another one whose name I never cared to learn about. And since this is a Winamp-like skin for Audacious, I decided to name it Winacious.
Ofcourse there are things I can't change but still this is a lot better than the original.

I know there are several locations in Linux where you can put the skin but I've noticed that Audacious detects it properly only in this path: /usr/share/audacious/Skins. It should work for the Windows version of the program but I have no idea where you should put the skin in Windows. The skin was created with Audacious 3.10.1-GTK3 and I'm currently using it in v4.4-2-GTK3, which IMO means it will work with any version that has the original blue skin from above. However, I've used it a few times with the QT build of Audacious and never noticed any problems.

The license is MIT which means you can do whatever you want with this skin.

Since the skin contains many files (mostly PNG images), I figured it would be easier to upload it as a 7z archive. Here's the full content of the archive:
